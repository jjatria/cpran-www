  short: Implement windowing algorithms with minimal effort
---
{% include JB/setup %}

The `window` plugin makes it easier to implement windowing algorithms by taking
care of the generation and handling of windows and providing extensible features
to customise what happens within those windows.

## Installation

Install using [CPrAN][]:

    cpran install window

You can download an [archive][] of the latest version for manual installation,
but you'll have to also manually install [the dependencies](#requirements)
yourself. You can manually install the plugin just like any other [Praat
plugin][plugins].
