  <p>tl;dr: I study the perception and production of suprasegmentals in second
languages, and in particular lexical prominence. I am currently studying the
bidirectional case of Spanish and Japanese as L2. <a href="cv.html">Here’s my CV</a>.</p>
</aside>

<p>My research interests are focused on the perception and production of
suprasegmentals (ie. intonation, stress, rhythm, that sort of thing), and I am
currently focused on these from the perspective of second language learners.</p>

<p>When we learn how to speak our first language, and we learn its contrasts and
rules, we are specially wired to do it automatically. We also do it
pre-linguistically (since we don’t know any languages by then). But when we
study a <em>second</em> (or third, or fourth) language we need to go through the same
process again, but now we need to do it from the starting point of the languages
we know, and compensating for how much less prepared we are in general to
acquire new languages later in life.</p>

<p>For my PhD, I’m looking at the perception and production of lexical prominence
in Japanese and Spanish as second languages, studied by native speakers of
Spanish and Japanese respectively. Even though the sounds in these two languages
are rather similar, their grammar and syntax are very different, as are their
ways to mark prominence. However, under certain circumstances, second language
learners have very little difficulty perceiving it…</p>

<p>I want to know why this is. What is it that makes it easy in some conditions
and hard in others, and how we can make it easier for students to learn these in
the future. Maybe while doing this we’ll learn something about the stress in
these languages as well.</p>

<p>You can find more detailed information in my <a href="cv.html">academic résumé</a>.</p>
