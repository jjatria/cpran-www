# NAME

**CPrAN** - A package manager for Praat

# SYNOPSIS

cpran <command> \[global options\] \[options\] \[arguments\]

# DESCRIPTION

**cpran** is the main script for an [App::Cmd](https://metacpan.org/pod/App::Cmd) application to search, install,
remove and update Praat plugins.

## Commands

- **update**

        cpran update [options]
        cpran update [options] [names]

    CPrAN keeps a list of the available plugins, with information about each one,
    including what its latest verion is and who is in charge of maintaining it.

    As its name implies, the **update** command takes care of keeping this list up to
    date, and as such it should probably be the first command to run.

    The list is currently implemented as individual files in the .cpran directory,
    which is under the CPrAN root. See [CPrAN::Command::update](update) for the full
    documentation.

- **search**

        cpran search [options] [regex [regex...]]

    **search** makes it possible to look for plugins in the plugin list. If you are
    not sure about the name of a plugin, you can use **search** to explore the list
    and try to find it. Or you can just use it to browse, to find unknown plugins
    that might do what you need.

    **search** will return a list of all plugin names that match the provided regular
    expression. By default, the query is performed against the plugin's name and short
    and long descriptions. You can specify these with the `--name` option, to limit
    the search to names, or the `--description` option, to only consider descriptions.

    More than one regex query can be provided by separating them with spaces. In this
    case, results from the search will include those plugins for which all queries
    apply. If you want to use a query that contains a space, you'll have to quote it.

    **search .\*** will show the entire list of plugins (beware that this might be a
    long list!). Alternatively, you can use the **list** command, which is simply an
    alias for this query.

    See [CPrAN::Command::search](search) for the full documentation.

- **show**

        cpran show [options] [names]

    Each plugin has a descriptor with general information about the plugin,
    including its name, version, homepage, maintainer, description, etc. **show**
    allows you to read the contents of this file.

    By default, it will show you the descriptors downloaded by **update**, but you
    can also use the **--installed** option to read the descriptors of installed
    plugins.

    See [CPrAN::Command::show](show) for the full documentation.

- **install**

        cpran install [options] [names]

    Once you've found a plugin with **search** and figured out if you want to install
    it or not thanks to **show**, you can use **install** to download a copy of the
    latest version to your local Praat preferences directory. If the plugin's
    descriptor specifies any dependencies, **install** will also offer to install
    these.

    You also use **install** to re-install a plugin that has already been installed
    with the **--force** option. This is useful if your local version somehow becomes
    corrupted (eg, if you've accidentally deleted files from within it).

    See [CPrAN::Command::install](install) for the full documentation.

- **upgrade**

        cpran upgrade
        cpran upgrade [options] [names]

    If a new version of an installed plugin has been released, you can use
    **upgrade** to bring your local installation up to date. You can specify a name
    to upgrade that individual plugin, or you can call it with no arguments, to
    upgrade all plugins that are out of date.

    See [CPrAN::Command::upgrade](upgrade) for the full documentation.

- **remove**

        cpran remove [options] [names]

    If you are not going to be using a plugin anymore, you can remove it with
    **remove**.

    See CPrAN::Command::remove for the full documentation.

- **test**

        cpran test [options] [names]

    By default, part of the installation process involves testing the downloaded
    plugin to make sure that things are working as expected.

    Both the testing and the aggregation of the test results is done by **test**.

    The command can be run manually on any downloaded plugin. When given the name of
    a plugin, regardless of whether it is a CPrAN plugin or not, it will look in
    that plugin's directory for a test directory.

    By default and convention, the test directory is named `t` and resides at the
    root of the plugin. Within this directory, all files that have a `.t` extension
    will be regarded as tests. Tests are all run by Praat, and they are expected to
    conform to the [Test Anything Protocol](http://testanything.org/) for correct
    evaluation. You might want to look at the
    [testsimple](https://gitlab.com/cpran/plugin_testsimple) plugin to make it
    easier to write tests.

    See [CPrAN::Command::test](test) for the full documentation.

- **remove**

        cpran remove [options] [names]

    If you are not going to be using a plugin anymore, you can remove it with
    **remove**.

    See CPrAN::Command::remove for the full documentation.

## Options

- **--praat**=PATH

    The path to use as the preferences directory for Praat. See the FILES section
    for information on the platform-dependant default values used.

- **--cpran**=PATH

    The path to use as the CPrAN root directory. See the FILES section
    for information on the platform-dependant default values used.

- **--api-token**=TOKEN
- **--api-group**=GROUP\_ID
- **--api-url**=URL

    These options set the credentials to talk to the GitLab API to obtain the
    plugin archives and descriptors. As such, it is implementation-dependant, and is
    currently tied to GitLab. These options are particularly useful if using CPrAN
    as an in-house plugin distribution system.

- **--verbose**, **--v**

    Increase the verbosity of the output. This option can be called multiple times
    to make the program even more talkative.

- **--quiet**, **--q**

    Opposed to **--verbose**, this option _suppresses_ all output. If both options
    are set simultaneously, this one takes precedence.

- **--debug**, **--D**

    Enables the output of debug information. Like **--verbose**, this option can be
    used multiple times to increase the number of debug messages that are printed.

# EXAMPLES

    cpran remove name

# FILES

## The preferences directory

**CPrAN** needs read and write access to _Praat_'s preferences directory. The
exact location for this directory varies according to the platform, so **CPrAN**
will keep the path to it, accessible through CPrAN::praat().

Below are the default locations for the main supported platforms:

- _UNIX_

    `~/.praat-dir`

- _Macintosh_

    `/Users/username/Library/Preferences/Praat/Prefs`

- _Windows_

    `C:\Documents and Settings\username\Praat`

Where `username` is, of course, the name of the active user.

## Plugin descriptors

**CPrAN** plugins are identified as such by the presence of a _plugin
descriptor_ in the plugin's root. The descriptor (named `cpran.yaml`) is a YAML
file with fields that identify the name and version of the plugin, what it does,
what its requirements are, etc.

A commented example is bundled with this module as `example.yaml`, but here is
a version stripped of comments, for simplicity:

    ---
    Plugin: name
    Homepage: https://example.com
    Version: 1.2.3
    Maintainer: A. N. Author <author@example.com>
    Depends:
      praat: 5.0.0+
    Recommends:
    License:
      - GPL3 <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html>
      - MIT <http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>
    Readme: readme.md
    Description:
      Short: an example of a plugin descriptor
      Long: >
        This file serves as an example of a CPrAN plugin descriptor.

        This long description is optional, but very useful to have.
        Line breaks in the long description will be converted to
        spaces, but you can start a new paragraph by using a blank
        line.

        Like so.

**CPrAN** uses YAML::XS to attempt to parse the descriptor. Any error in parsing
will be treated by **CPrAN** in the same way as if the file was missing, so it's
important to properly validate the descriptor beforehand.

## The plugin list

To keep track of available plugins, **CPrAN** keeps the descriptors for all the
plugins it knows about, and queries them for information when necessary. This is
the list that known() looks in, and the list from where the **show** command gets
its data.

The descriptors are saved in a **CPrAN** root folder whose path is stored
internally and accessible through CPrAN::root(). By default, it will be a
directory named `.cpran` in the root of the **CPrAN** plugin (CPrAN::praat() .
'/plugin\_cpran'). In that directory, the descriptors are renamed with the name
of the plugin they represent.

This list is updated with the **update** command.
